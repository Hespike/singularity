    <h1>3. Using Ability Scores</h1>

    <p>Each character has five core ability scores that define their essential traits. These are:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Might:</strong> Represents the hero’s physical strength.</li>
        <li><strong>Agility:</strong> Reflects the hero’s dexterity and speed.</li>
        <li><strong>Endurance:</strong> Measures the hero’s stamina and resilience.</li>
        <li><strong>Wits:</strong> Indicates the hero’s mental acuity and focus.</li>
        <li><strong>Charm:</strong> Expresses the hero’s charisma and force of personality.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These abilities play a crucial role during gameplay, as they influence the outcome of the most important dice rolls:
        <strong>ability/skill checks</strong>, <strong>saving throws</strong>, and <strong>attack rolls</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        A score of 0 represents an average level of ability—neither exceptional nor deficient.
        Characters with a 0 in an ability perform as a typical, untrained individual in that area.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Training rank</h2>

    <p>
        Heroes are skilled in various abilities, each of which progresses through five distinct levels of proficiency.
        All skills start at the Novice level.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Novice</strong>: The hero has minimal experience with the skill. They can perform basic tasks but lack the expertise
            to handle complex or advanced situations with ease. When attempting a skill check, you may only add your ability score to the roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Apprentice</strong>: The hero has some practical experience and can handle simple tasks reliably.
            They are beginning to grasp the fundamentals but are not yet fully competent.
            When attempting a skill check, add your ability and 5 to the roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Competent</strong>: The hero is capable and has a solid understanding of the skill.
            They can handle most situations effectively and consistently but might still struggle with particularly difficult challenges.
            When attempting a skill check, add your ability and 10 to the roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Masterful</strong>: The hero is an expert in the skill.
            They consistently perform tasks at a high level, often exceeding expectations.
            They handle even the most difficult situations with precision and ease.
            When attempting a skill check, add your ability and 15 to the roll.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Legendary</strong>: The hero has reached the pinnacle of the skill.
            Their mastery is unmatched, and they can perform feats that most others can only dream of.
            They are considered a true icon in their field, capable of accomplishing extraordinary tasks.
            When attempting a skill check, add your ability and 20 to the roll.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="mt-4">Ability Checks</h2>

    <p>
        When a hero attempts to do something that isn’t trivial, they must perform an <strong>ability check</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The Architect decides when a roll is necessary, which ability or skill is involved, and sets the difficulty of the task.
    </p>

    <div class="table-responsive">
        <table class="table table-bordered border border-dark">
            <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>DC</th>
                <th>Difficulty Description</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>5</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Trivial</strong> - Routine actions a typical civilian succeeds at without thinking (walking a narrow path, recalling common knowledge). Failure is rare unless distracted or impaired.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>10</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Easy</strong> - Tasks that most civilians can accomplish with minimal effort or focus (climbing a short fence, basic first aid, noticing obvious danger).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>15</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Moderate</strong> - A standard challenge for <strong>trained individuals or starting heroes</strong> (bypassing a simple lock, tracking a suspect, holding your ground under fire).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>20</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Hard</strong> - Demands <strong>expert training or heroic capability</strong> (advanced hacking, precise combat maneuvers, resisting intense physical or mental stress).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>25</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Very Hard</strong> - <strong>Elite or superheroic feats</strong> that only specialists or powerful heroes perform reliably (outmaneuvering elite opponents, surviving extreme environments, complex battlefield tactics).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>30</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Nearly Impossible</strong> - <strong>Legendary or superhuman feats</strong>, achievable only under exceptional circumstances (stopping a speeding vehicle barehanded, outthinking master strategists mid-combat, enduring catastrophic force).</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </div>

    <p>
        During an ability check, you roll a 20-sided die and add the relevant ability.
        If the result equals or exceeds the DC, the task is considered successful.
    </p>

    <h2>Skills</h2>

    <p>Characters possess <strong>abilities</strong>, not skills by default.</p>
    <p>
        Skills represent <strong>specialized training</strong> and are only listed on a character sheet
        if the character has invested training in them.
        If you are <strong>not trained</strong> in a skill, you make the check using <strong>only the relevant ability</strong>.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

    <p>
        A superhero wants to <strong>hack a secure facility’s system</strong> to open a locked door.
        The character has no training in hacking, so she is considered a <strong>Novice in Hacking.</strong>
        She <strong>does not add a skill proficiency bonus</strong>.
        She uses her <strong>Wits</strong> ability, since hacking relies on technical knowledge and focus.
    </p>

    <p><strong>The roll:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>1d20 + Wits modifier</strong></p>

    <p>Each skill, when trained, is linked to an ability:</p>

    <h3>Skills by Ability</h3>

            <ul>

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Charm</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Deception</li>
                <li>Intimidation</li>
                <li>Performance</li>
                <li>Persuasion</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        These skills are only suggestions. Depending on your setting and world, the Architect may introduce additional skills as needed.
        The final decision on which ability modifier applies to a given skill always rests with the Architect.
