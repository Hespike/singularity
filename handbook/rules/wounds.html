    <h1>Wounds & Dying</h1>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Falling to 0 HP</h3>
    <p>
        When a character’s HP is reduced to 0, the following occurs:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Gain a Wound:</strong> The player immediately rolls 1d20 on the <a href="wound_table.html">Wound Table</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Unconscious:</strong> The character falls unconscious, becomes prone and is unable to take actions, move, or use reactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Persistent Penalties:</strong> If the character receives healing, they regain consciousness and may act again, but the Wound remains. The penalties from Wounds persist until the injury is treated.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4">The Wound Limit (Death)</h3>
    <p>
        A character dies when their body can no longer sustain the accumulated trauma. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>The Threshold:</strong> You die if your total Wound Value equals or exceeds <strong>3 + your Endurance</strong>.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A <strong>Standard Wound</strong> counts as 1 toward this limit.</li>
        <li>An <strong>Extreme Wound</strong> counts as 3 toward this limit.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Extreme Wounds</h3>
    <p>
        An injury is classified as an Extreme Wound if it is significantly more debilitating. An injury becomes an Extreme Wound in the following scenarios:
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Critical Trauma:</strong> The character is reduced to 0 HP by an enemy’s <strong>Extreme Success</strong> on an attack or the character’s <strong>Extreme Failure</strong> on a saving throw.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Aggravated Injury:</strong> The player rolls a result on the Wound Table that they <strong>already possess</strong> (e.g., rolling "Left Leg" while already suffering from a "Left Leg" wound).
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Healing and Recovery</h3>
    <p>
        Wounds are not removed by standard "instant" healing (like med-kits or restorative powers), though such healing does restore HP and consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Wounds:</strong> These are healed and removed after the character completes a <strong>Long Rest</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Extreme Wounds:</strong> These are more severe and do not heal naturally during a rest. They can only be healed by specific, advanced medical means or high-cost interventions.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">NPC Rules & Non-Lethal Intent</h3>
    <p>
        This system is designed for Player Characters and Important NPCs. Standard enemies and "minions" are typically defeated or removed from play instantly when reduced to 0 HP.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default, all attacks made by Player Characters are considered <strong>non-lethal</strong>. There are no penalties for choosing to knock an opponent out rather than killing them. However, players may declare an attack to be <strong>lethal</strong> at the time the attack is made if they intend to kill their target.
