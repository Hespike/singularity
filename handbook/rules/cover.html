    <h1>Cover</h1>
    <p class="mt-3">
        Cover represents any physical obstacle that provides protection from attacks by blocking line of sight or line of effect. It plays a crucial role in combat, allowing creatures to gain a defensive edge by positioning themselves behind barriers.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Degrees of Cover</h3>
    
    <p class="mt-3">
        <strong>Minor Cover (+2 to AC and Agility Saves):</strong><br>
        Small obstacles such as low walls, furniture, or partial obstructions. These provide minimal protection but can still make the difference in a tight battle.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Standard Cover (+4 to AC and Agility Saves):</strong><br>
        Medium-sized obstacles like thick trees, full walls, or barricades that block at least half of the creature’s body.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>Total Cover:</strong><br>
        The creature is completely hidden or protected from the attacker’s point of view, such as being behind a solid wall. The attacker cannot target the creature directly unless using specific abilities or effects.
    </p>

    <p class="text-muted">
        <em>If you want to increase the defensive benefit of cover, you can use the <strong>Take Cover</strong> action.</em>
    </p>

    <hr class="mt-5">

    <h3 class="mt-4">Cover Provided by Creatures</h3>
    <p>
        Any creature positioned between an attacker and their target provides cover to the defender. By default, each creature between the attacker and the target grants a <strong>+2 bonus</strong> to the target’s AC.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the creature providing cover is not the same size as the target, the bonus is modified based on the <strong>Size Modifier</strong> difference between the cover-providing creature and the defender:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Larger creatures offer more substantial cover.</li>
        <li>Smaller creatures offer less or potentially no effective cover.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The Architect may determine the exact bonus based on relative size, positioning, and how much of the target is obscured.
    </p>

    <h5 class="mt-4">Example:</h5>
    <p>
        A Large creature (+1 Size Modifier) standing between a Medium defender (Size Modifier 0) and the attacker might provide +3 AC instead of +2. Conversely, a Small creature (–2 Size Modifier) may only provide +1. A tiny creature provides no cover at all.
    </p>
