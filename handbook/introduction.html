      <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

      <h2 class="mt-4">What is Singularity?</h2>
      <p>
        In short, Singularity is a free tabletop RPG system that supports
        multi-genre gameplay, whether you're looking for a futuristic setting or
        a superhero adventure.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mt-4">What Inspired Its Creation?</h2>
      <p>
        After many years of playing role-playing games, we started thinking
        about trying something new—something that breaks away from the typical
        fantasy D&D format. We dove into stacks of books and explored numerous
        communities, hoping to find the ideal futuristic or superhero RPG
        system. Unfortunately, the results were disappointing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Most of the systems we found suffered from significant flaws or outright
        deal-breakers, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>No support for battlemaps.</li>
        <li>Rules that were overly generic or lacked thematic flavor.</li>
        <li>
          Systems that were overly complex, often contradictory, and difficult
          to navigate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Character and adventure creation that was so “crunchy” and rules-heavy
          that many players couldn’t build a compliant character without
          third-party apps.
        </li>
        <li>
          A limited selection of character classes that quickly became
          repetitive after just a few adventures or modules.
        </li>
        <li>
          Settings so narrowly focused that they offered almost no
          replayability.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        At this point, you might ask:
        <em
          >So, is this just a revamped version of already existing systems?</em
        >
      </p>

      <p>Not quite.</p>

      <p>
        Our goal wasn’t just to overhaul something old, it was to selectively
        recycle familiar and beloved elements from other RPG systems and enrich
        them with our own design philosophy. In many cases, we completely
        rethought and redesigned existing mechanics to better fit our vision.
      </p>

      <p>
        Thanks to its modular structure, Singularity is built to grow. The
        system is easy to expand and customize, and our intent is to continually
        evolve it with new rules and content, closely shaped by the needs and
        feedback of the community.
