    <h1>1. Introduction</h1>

    <h2 class="mt-4">What is Singularity?</h2>
    <p>
        In short, Singularity is a free tabletop RPG system that supports multi-genre gameplay,
        whether you're looking for a futuristic setting or a superhero adventure.
    </p>

    <h2 class="mt-4">What Inspired Its Creation?</h2>
    <p>
        After many years of playing role-playing games, we started thinking about trying something new—
        something that breaks away from the typical fantasy D&D format.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>No support for battlemaps.</li>
        <li>Rules that were overly generic or lacked thematic flavor.</li>
        <li>Systems that were overly complex or contradictory.</li>
        <li>Character creation too crunchy without third-party tools.</li>
        <li>Limited classes and replayability.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Not quite. Singularity selectively recycles familiar mechanics and redesigns them
        with a modular, expandable philosophy shaped by community feedback.
