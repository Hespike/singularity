    <h1>Marksman</h1>

    <p>
        The <strong>Marksman</strong> is a master of precision combat, relying on skill, focus,
        and timing rather than raw power. With a steady hand and sharp eyes, Marksmen excel
        at taking out targets from a distance, and exploiting
        weaknesses in their enemies’ defenses.
    </p>

    <h3 class="mt-4">Example Heroes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Deadshot</strong> (DC Comics) – A literal living weapon, Deadshot can hit almost any target with deadly accuracy, often using trick shots and strategic positioning.</li>
        <li><strong>Bullseye</strong> (Marvel Comics) – Known for turning anything into a lethal projectile, his precision and creativity make him a feared Marksman.</li>
        <li><strong>Hawkeye</strong> (Marvel Comics) – A master archer who combines agility, precision, and tactical thinking to outmaneuver opponents.</li>
    </ul>
