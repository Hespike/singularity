      <h1>2. Step-by-Step Character Creation</h1>

      <h2 class="mt-4">Character Creation</h2>
      <p>
        During a session, each player plays a character. This character is
        usually referred to as a “<strong>Hero</strong>” in this game. In this
        game, the Game Master is referred to as
        <strong>"The Architect."</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        A Hero consists of two distinct yet interconnected aspects: on one hand,
        they are defined by various motivations, personality traits,
        relationships with the world, worldview, and numerous other factors that
        shape the Hero's unique essence. These elements can be freely chosen by
        the player and do not have specific modifiers that appear on the
        character sheet.
      </p>

      <p>
        On the other hand, Heroes are also defined by technical details that
        primarily affect dice rolls. Like in many other games, Heroes have a
        Phenotype, a Background, and a Powerset, each offering distinct
        advantages and, in some cases, disadvantages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Character creation can be an individual process, but we strongly
        recommend discussing your choices with fellow players and The Architect
        beforehand. This ensures that everyone understands each other's
        abilities, making the game more varied and enjoyable for all. This
        approach aligns with the logic of most games, as teams often strive for
        diversity to be as well-prepared as possible for various challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        When creating your Hero, it is beneficial to follow the sequence
        outlined below. Once you have your concept in mind, begin by selecting a
        Powerset, followed by a Phenotype and a Subtype, and then a Background.
      </p>

      <p class="mt-4">
        Alternatively, if you want to jump straight into the action, you can choose to play a 
        <a href="character_creation/pregens.html" class="text-decoration-none"><strong>pregenerated character</strong></a>.
      </p>
      <p class="mt-4">
        You can find the empty character sheet used for the pregenerated characters <a href="character_creation/pregens/empty_character_sheet.html" class="text-decoration-none"><strong>here</strong></a>.
      </p>
      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4"><a href="character_creation/powersets.html">1. Choose a Powerset</a></h3>
      <p>The Powerset defines the Hero's most important abilities.</p>

      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4"><a href="character_creation/phenotypes.html">2. Choose a Phenotype and a Subtype</a></h3>
      <p>
        A <strong>Phenotype</strong> represents your Hero's species. A Hero
        unlocks different abilities based on their Phenotype as they continue to
        develop. Each Phenotype may also have a <strong>Subtype</strong>, which
        further defines their biological or inherent traits.
      </p>
      <p>There are two types of Subtypes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Phenotype-Specific Subtypes</strong> – only available to
          Heroes of a certain Phenotype, e.g., some can only be chosen if your
          Hero is human.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Non-Phenotype-Specific Subtypes</strong> – more flexible and
          can be selected regardless of the Hero’s Phenotype.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4"><a href="character_creation/backgrounds.html">3. Choose a Background</a></h3>
      <p>
        Your Background typically represents the type of activity your Hero
        engaged in before embarking on their current adventures.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4"><a href="ability_scores.html">4. Calculate Your Ability Scores</a></h3>
      <p>
        Each Hero has five Ability Scores that define their general attributes:
        <strong>Might</strong>, <strong>Agility</strong>,
        <strong>Endurance</strong>, <strong>Wits</strong>, and
        <strong>Charm</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When determining your final Ability Scores,
        <strong
          >add or subtract any ability points gained from different
          sources</strong
        >, such as Phenotype, Subtype, Background, or Powerset.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4"><a href="character_creation/talents.html">5. Choose Your Talents</a></h3>
      <p>
        The most important elements of every character are their Talents. You always receive a fixed number of them, which you can see in the
<a href="character_creation/progression_table.html">progression table</a>,
specifying when and how many you get exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Talents often have prerequisites, which must be met before you can
        select a particular Talent. These prerequisites can include Prime Level,
        Ability Score requirements, or other existing Talent requirements.
      </p>

      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4"><a href="equipment.html">6. Equipment</a></h3>
      <p>
        Equipment includes weapons, armors and other tools that your Hero starts with or acquires, which can provide additional bonuses or capabilities in various situations.
