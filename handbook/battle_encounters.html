      <h1>4. Battle Encounters & Rules</h1>

      <p>
        Cases where two or more opposing parties engage in combat are called
        battle encounters. Battle encounters consist of <strong>rounds</strong>.
        A round is the time interval (usually 6 seconds) during which each
        character performs various actions. When each character has finished
        their round, a turn ends and a new one begins. These turns repeat as
        long as the parties are actively fighting.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Initiative</h3>
      <p>
        The characters decide who is next with an initiative roll, which is
        rolled at the beginning of the fight. Any character may choose to reduce
        their initiative at the start of battle. This decision cannot be changed
        later and must be kept until the end of the encounter.
      </p>

      <h3 class="mt-4">Energy and Actions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          At the start of their turn, each character receives
          <strong>4 energy</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
          Characters may spend energy to perform any combination of actions,
          such as moving, attacking, casting powers, or using items.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each action has a specific energy cost, which is subtracted from the
          character's total.
        </li>
        <li>
          A character may spend their energy in any order they choose. They are
          not required to spend all their energy and may skip actions entirely.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <hr />

      <h3 class="mt-4">Out of Combat Turns</h3>
      <p>
        In some cases, it may be justified for characters to move in turns
        outside of combat, such as hiding during a heist or moving stealthily.
        The The Architect decides whether turn-based tracking is necessary in these
        situations.
