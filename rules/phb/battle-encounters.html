<h1>Battle Encounters</h1>
<p>Cases where two or more opposing parties engage in combat are called battle encounters. Battle encounters consist of rounds. A round means the time interval (usually 6 seconds) until which a character performs various actions. When each character has finished their round, a turn ends and a new one begins. 
    These turns are repeated as long as the parties are actively fighting each other.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<p>The characters decide who is next with an initiative roll, which is rolled at the beginning of the fight. Any character may choose to reduce their initiative as a quasi-free action at the start of battle. The given character cannot change this decision later and must keep this initiative until the end of the encounter.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Action types</h3>
<p>A player can usually perform 3 actions during a round. These actions may include:</p>
<h4>Mobility Action</h4>
<p>During the mobility action, the given character can perform various activities related to positioning and movement.</p>
<h4>Battle Action</h4>
<p>During the battle action, the given character can attack and cast spells. </p>
<h4>Extra Action</h4>
<p>During the extra action, the given character can consume items, use skills and perform other activities.</p>
<h3>General rules of actions</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Each character may perform 1 of any action type per turn.</li>
    <li>You don't have to take every action every turn. In fact, you can decide to skip your own round entirely.</li>
    <li>The actions can be performed in any order, but cannot be interrupted by another action (for example, performing an attack while moving is not allowed. You must move either before the attack or after the attack).</li>
    <li>Specific abilities can override these rules, but this is always supported by an example in the description of the given ability.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h3>Out of combat turns</h3>
<p>In some cases, it may be justified for the characters to move in turns outside of combat. This can be the case, for example, when they hide during a heist, move stealthily, and it can be relevant who is coming. In this case, it is the GM's task to decide whether it is worth proceeding in a turn-based manner.</p>
