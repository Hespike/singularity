<h1>Backgrounds</h1>
<p>By a character's backstory, we mean everything he has done up to the time the adventure begins. This includes much more than the few modifiers you get from the backgrounds. <br>
    Each character has different external and internal personality traits. Appearance can include your weight, height, age in a certain sense, and your appearance. In many cases, it is worth specifying several "appearances" if you have an "ordinary civilian" look and a superhero look. <br>
    What is usually much more important are the inner qualities of the character. This includes his world view, his alingment, his relationship with different members or groups in the world, his faults and many other things. The game does not have a strict alignment system, precisely because, on the one hand, most characters are ideally much more nuanced than being able to be classified into strict categories, and on the other hand, a skilled game master can bring out a different face of the characters as they react to extreme situations. <br>
    We recommend that the creation of the character's personality should also be a group task, together with the game master and fellow players. In our opinion, an ideal team has personalities who are able to work together in most cases, but who have different attitudes towards different moral issues. With the right balance of these, you can create game sessions where the characters and the npck not only clash in battle, but also a moral struggle takes place. <br>
    In addition, choose a Background suitable for your world, which you can find below and which gives your character different bonuses.
