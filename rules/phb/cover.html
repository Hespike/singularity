<h1>Cover rules</h1>
<p>The sniper hides behind a car when mobsters open fire on him.<br>
    The whole team hides behind the big hero, who protects his teammates with his body.<br>
    Paragon tries to hunt down his opponent, but he disappears in a massive crowd of people.<br>
    <hr>
    A lot of times the defending character will have some kind of advantage because it is harder to hit her due to objects and people in front of her. Unlike other systems, in Singularity's system, modifiers from covers STACK WITH EACH OTHER. This developer decision was made because, in our opinion, the rules related to covers are intuitive and cause confusion only in the first fight, but later they significantly contribute to making the fight as tactical as possible and positioning plays an important role during encounters.</p>
