    A lot of times the defending character will have some kind of advantage because
     it is harder to hit her due to objects and people in front of her. All objects and characters provide cover
      that touches the line between the center of the attacking party's token and the center of the defending party's token at any level.
       Unlike other systems, 
     in Singularity's system, modifiers from covers STACK WITH EACH OTHER. This developer decision was made because, 
     in our opinion, the rules related to covers are intuitive and cause confusion only in the first fight, 
     but later they significantly contribute to making the fight as
      tactical as possible.</p>

<p>The total bonus a character gets from covers looks like this:
    <strong>Total Defensive Prowess bonus = Cover from other characters + Cover from objects</strong></p>
      <hr>
<h3>Cover from another characters</h3>
<p>Any character between the attacker and defender gives the defender a bonus. 
    This does not change whether the character is friend or foe, participates in the fight or not.</p>
<h4>Calculating the bonus</h4>
<p>What should be considered when calculating cover is the size of the defender and the size of those providing cover. All characters of the same size as the defender who fall in the line of attack give +1 Defensive Prowess to the defender.
    Apart from different talents and special actions, there are two important things that change this:</p>
    <h5>Size:</h5>
<ul>
 <li>Characters larger than their defensive size give +1 Defensive Prowess for each size category.</li>
 <li>Characters smaller than the defender's size give -1  Defensive Prowess for each size category (minimum 0).</li>
 <li>If the size difference is greater than or equal 3(for example the defender is tiny creature and the one giving cover is large, or the defender is medium and the one giving cover is super-huge) then the defending creature is in absolute cover and cannot be targeted by any positive or negative effect(area damage can still effect her). </li>
</ul>
<h5>Prone condition</h5>
<ul>
<li>Prone characters give -1 less Defensive Prowess (minimum 0).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<p>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of <strong>medium</strong> size. There are three characters between them, all of them are medium size. -> 1 medium character + 1 medium character + 1 medium character = the defender gets +3 Defensive Prowess</p>
<p>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of <strong>small</strong> size. There are two characters between them, both of them are medium size. -> 1 medium character worths 2 Defensive Prowess because the defender is one size smaller + 1 medium character worths 2 Defensive Prowess because the defender is one size smaller = the defender gets +4 Defensive Prowess</p>
<p>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of <strong>large</strong> size. There are two characters between them, one of them is medium size and the other one is large . -> 1 medium character worths 0 Defensive Prowess because the defender is one size larger + 1 large character worths 1 Defensive Prowess because, because she is same size as the defender = the defender gets +1 Defensive Prowess</p>
<p>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of <strong>large</strong> size. There are two characters between them, one of them is medium size and the other one is small. -> 1 medium character worths 0 Defensive Prowess because the defender is one size larger + 1 small character worths 0 Defensive Prowess because the defender is two size larger, and the bonus can not be negative = the defender gets +0 Defensive Prowess</p>
<p>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of <strong>medium</strong> size. There are two characters between them, one of them is a medium size prone character and the other one is small. -> 1 medium character, who is prone worths 0 Defensive Prowess + 1 small character worths 0 Defensive Prowess because the defender is one size larger, and the bonus can not be negative = the defender gets +0 Defensive Prowess</p>
<p>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of <strong>tiny</strong> size. There is one characters between them, she is large, but she is prone. -> 1 large character gives absolute cover to the creature behind her(tiny-small-medium-large the size difference between them is 3), so it doesn't matter if the creature giving the cover is prone.  = the defender can't be targeted</p>

<hr>

<h3>Cover from objects</h3>
<p>Any object between the attacker and defender gives the defender a bonus. While the covers provided by other characters were relatively "set in stone" and clear, those provided by objects are much more relative, as they depend significantly on location and size. While a bus provides absolute cover for most creatures, it may only provide partial cover for a huge creature. A brick lying on the ground means insignificant cover for most characters, while it can even mean absolute cover for an extremely shrinking character. On the other hand, if someone shoots at these characters from the side, they can provide one less cover in both cases.
</p>

<h4> Three golden rules </h4>
    <ol>
    <li>You can suggest if you feel a cover is different from what the game master says, but the final decision is always the game master's and is not subject to debate.</li>
    <li>The game master should indicate each time what kind of cover the various landmarks provide for the character, or if someone wants to attack someone, indicate how much DP bonus the defending character will have from covers. It is logical to think that, in most cases, the attacking character himself sees how many obstacles are in front of him to hit his opponent.</li>
<li>If you are unsure about which cover to use, just use the "Cover from another character" rules as a basis. In most cases, the continuity of the game is more important than having an argument or slowing down the game unenjoyably.</li>
</ol>
    <h4>Calculating the bonus</h4>
<p>We distinguish between four different types of cover</p>
<h5>Cover size:</h5>
<ul>
    <li>Insignificant cover: a cover behind which the character is totally visible. It provides no extra Defensive Prowess. Example: For a medium creature a fire hydrant or a roller could give irrelevant cover.</li>
    <li>Partial cover: a cover behind which the character is visible. It provides +2 Defensive Prowess. Example: For a medium creature a small fence or a motorbike could give partial cover.</li>
  <li>Complete cover: a cover that cover the silhouette of the defending character. It provides +4 Defensive Prowess. Example: For a medium creature a wall or a car could give partial cover.</li>
    <li>Absolute cover: cover that completely covers the character, in which case the character cannot be attacked.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Examples</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of medium size. The defender standing behind a car, which according to the gamemaster gives her complete cover. -> 1 complete cover = the defender gets +4 Defensive Prowess</li>
    <li>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of large size. The defender standing behind a car, which according to the gamemaster gives her partial cover, because she is too tall to get complete cover behind a car. -> 1 partial cover = the defender gets +2 Defensive Prowess</li>
    <li>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of large size. The defender standing behind a car, which according to the gamemaster gives her partial cover, because she is too tall to get complete cover behind a car. -> 1 partial cover = the defender gets +2 Defensive Prowess</li>
    <li>The attacker wants to fire his pistol at the defender. The defender is of small size. The defender standing behind a car, which according to the gamemaster gives her absolute cover, because she is small. -> 1 absolute cover = The gamemaster informs the attacker that his target is in full cover. The attacker will probably choose another target instead.</li>
    <li>The attacker fires his pistol at the defender. The defender is of medium size. Between the defender and the attacker there are two lamp posts, a mailbox and a car, but the car just touches the line of attack. The gamemaster judges that the two lamp posts and the mailbox provide partial cover, because even though they are in the way, they make the defender visible. The car falls too far out of the line of attack, so the gamemaster decides that the car provides insignificant cover in this case. -> 1 partial cover(lamp) + 1 partial cover(lamp) + 1 partial cover(mailbox) + 1 irrelevant cover(car) = the defender gets +6 Defensive Prowess</li>
</ul>
